Still need to write some kind of introduction text for this release...

Anyways, in the mean time:

Enjoy the (beta) release!

[devblog]: https://developers.home-assistant.io/blog/

{% details "Phone Modem" %}

The previously deprecated `modem_callerid.reject_call` service, has now been
removed. A button entity has previously been made available as a replacement.

([@frenck] - [#69019]) ([documentation](/integrations/modem_callerid))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#69019]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69019

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Zengge" %}

Zengge lights no longer support `white_value`, please use `white` instead.

([@emontnemery] - [#55260]) ([documentation](/integrations/zengge))

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#55260]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/55260

{% enddetails %}

{% details "IKEA TRÅDFRI" %}

The native IKEA TRÅDFRI groups are now removed. We propose using
[light groups](/integrations/group/) instead. 

Additionally, the previously deprecated YAML configuration of the IKEA TRÅDFRI
integration has been removed.

IKEA TRÅDFRI is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

([@ggravlingen] - [#68033]) ([documentation](/integrations/tradfri))

[@ggravlingen]: https://github.com/ggravlingen
[#68033]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/68033

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MJPEG IP Camera" %}

The previously deprecated YAML configuration of the MJPEG IP Camera
integration has been removed.

MJPEG IP Camera is now configured via the UI, any existing YAML
configuration has been imported in previous releases and can now be safely
removed from your YAML configuration files.

([@frenck] - [#68033]) ([documentation](/integrations/mjpeg))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#68980]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/68980

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Vera" %}

Vera power meter sensor is now using the (correct) symbol `W` for watt instead
of `watts`.

If you relied on this unit of measurement format in your automations, scripts
or have been recording it in an external time metrics database, you may need
to adopt to this change.

([@emontnemery] - [#69285]) ([documentation](/integrations/vera))

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#69285]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69285

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit" %}

The device class `carbon_dioxide` is no longer admitted as a `binary_sensor`
device class; as its not a valid device class for a binary sensor. If you have
overridden the device class with customize need to adjust your configuration.

([@epenet] - [#69239]) ([documentation](/integrations/homekit))

[@epenet]: https://github.com/epenet
[#69239]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69239

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Recorder" %}

Home Assistant will now automatically repack your database once a month, on 
the second sunday of the month.

Repacking allows to shrink the database in file size, resulting in smaller
backups. It also frees up the space that has been freed up by the database
optimizations made in 2022.4.

Some notes:

- It is only done once a month to minimize I/O.
- The second Sunday was chosen as it would be out of sync with Home Assistant
  releases.
- This automatic repacking can be disabled by setting `auto_repack` to `false`
  in the recorder configuration

([@bdraco] - [#69314]) ([documentation](/integrations/recorder))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#69314]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69314

---

It's no longer possible to configure the recorder to use an in-memory database.

([@emontnemery] - [#69616]) ([documentation](/integrations/recorder))

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#69616]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69616

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Flick Electric" %}

Units changed from `cents` to `¢/kWh`. This more accurately represent the type
of value, and makes the sensor work when used in the Energy dashboards.

If you relied on this unit of measurement format in your automations, scripts
or have been recording it in an external time metrics database, you may need
to adopt to this change.

([@ZephireNZ] - [#69396]) ([documentation](/integrations/flick_electric))

[@ZephireNZ]: https://github.com/ZephireNZ
[#69396]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69396

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Radarr" %}

The previously deprecated Wanted sensor in the Radarr integration has been
removed. If you have this sensor still configured it your YAML configuration,
you should remove it before updating.

([@tkdrob] - [#69500]) ([documentation](/integrations/radarr))

[@tkdrob]: https://github.com/tkdrob
[#69500]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69500

{% enddetails %}

{% details "UPnP/IGD" %}

The UPnP/IGD integration options have been removed. This includes the
ability to configure a custom update/scan interval.

As an alternative, the more generic and more flexible
`homeassistant.update_entity` service can be used to create an automation that
updates the entities on your desired intervals or schedule.

([@StevenLooman] - [#69134]) ([documentation](/integrations/upnp))

[@StevenLooman]: https://github.com/StevenLooman
[#69134]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69134

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Integration - Riemann sum integral" %}

The Integration sensor `unit` configuration parameter was deprecated in
Home Assistant Core release 2021.10 and is now removed as it did not
take `unit_prefix` and `unit_time` into account.

Example:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: integration
    source: sensor.current_power
    name: energy_spent
    unit_prefix: k
    unit_time: h
    unit: MWs
    round: 2
```

The configuration in the example would cause the source sensor's unit
(e.g. `W`) tobe over ruled and the integration sensor's `unit_of_measurement`
would be set to `MWs` (MegaWatt-Second) even though the integral calculation
was performed with `k` (kilo) and `h` (hour), i.e. the value of the integration
sensor is in `kWh` not `MWs`.

([@dgomes] - [#69157]) ([documentation](/integrations/integration))

[@dgomes]: https://github.com/dgomes
[#69157]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69157

{% enddetails %}

{% details "BMW Connected Drive" %}

All `bmw_connected_drive.*` services are removed (deprecated since 2022.2).
Please use the new button entities with the `button.press` service instead.

([@rikroe] - [#69808]) ([documentation](/integrations/bmw_connected_drive))

[@rikroe]: https://github.com/rikroe
[#69808]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69808

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Media Source" %}

Filenames and directories starting with a `.`, will no longer appear in the
Media Browser.

If the file or directory name starts with a `.`, it means they are marked
hidden; thus the media browser will now repect that.

([@DDanii] - [#69820]) ([documentation](/integrations/bmw_connected_drive))

[@DDanii]: https://github.com/DDanii
[#69820]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69820

{% enddetails %}

{% details "RainMachine" %}

RainMachine zone switches no longer have the `time_remaining` attribute;
instead, each zone now has a separate sensor entity (device class of `timestamp`,
entity category of `diagnostic`) that shows the datetime at which the zone will
finish (or last finished if the zone isn't running).

([@bachya] - [#69206]) ([documentation](/integrations/rainmachine))

[@bachya]: https://github.com/bachya
[#69206]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69206

---

RainMachine switch attributes that are `floats` are now rounded to two decimals
of precision.

([@bachya] - [#70006]) ([documentation](/integrations/rainmachine))

[@bachya]: https://github.com/bachya
[#70006]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/70006

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Pentair ScreenLogic" %}

The original `orp_supply_level` and `ph_supply_level` sensors will become
unavailable. Two new sensors will be automatically created, but the originals
will have to be removed and the new ones manually renamed to match the originals.

This should only affect those with IntelliChem.

([@dieselrabbit] - [#69937]) ([documentation](/integrations/screenlogic))

[@dieselrabbit]: https://github.com/dieselrabbit
[#69937]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/69937

{% enddetails %}

## Farewell to the following

The following integrations are also no longer available as of this release:

- **Updater** was previously deprecated has been removed. Use the [Version]
  and [Analytics] integrations as a replacement.
  ([@frenck] - [#68981])
- **Digital Loggers** has been removed. It relied on web scraping, which is
  [not allowed][ADR-0004] for a Home Assistant Core integration.
